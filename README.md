Running Process:
Download all the files:
and run directly "app.py"
the address of the folders should be same as your Device.

The code for preprocess the data and feature engineering code is also given.
Also the code of how i trained the machine using dataset.
This datasets are download from github and Kaggle, all are the static stored datasets.
I've added two columns in the dataset as per the project requirements "user_id", "username".




Spotify Song Recommendation System - Simple Explanation ðŸŽµ

This project is a Spotify Song Recommendation System that suggests songs to users based on their listening history. It works by analyzing user preferences and comparing them with similar users to recommend songs they might enjoy.
How It Works?
1.	User Input â†’ The user enters their User ID on the website.
2.	Data Processing â†’ The system checks the songs the user has listened to and compares them with other users.
3.	Recommendation Algorithm â†’ It uses cosine similarity to find users with similar music tastes.
4.	Generating Song List â†’ Based on similar users' listening habits, the system recommends the top songs.
5.	Displaying Results â†’ The recommended songs appear on a new page with a clean and interactive design.

6.	
Why is this Useful?
â€¢	Helps users discover new songs based on their preferences.
â€¢	Uses Machine Learning techniques to make smart recommendations.
â€¢	Provides an interactive and user-friendly web interface.
This project showcases how data science and web development work together to create personalized recommendations! ðŸš€ðŸŽ¶
